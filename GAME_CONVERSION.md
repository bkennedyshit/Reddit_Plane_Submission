# Game Conversion: BMX Challenge → Sky Racer

## Overview
Converted the BMX racing game into a jet plane city-flying game with enhanced mechanics and visual effects.

## Key Changes

### Game Concept
- **From**: Ground-based BMX racing with jumps and grinds
- **To**: Aerial jet plane navigation through a cityscape

### Physics Engine
- Replaced ground-based physics with flight mechanics
- Added vertical movement (up/down controls)
- Lighter gravity for sustained flight
- Altitude boundaries (ceiling and ground)
- Speed boost system

### Controls
| Action | Keys | Effect |
|--------|------|--------|
| Fly Up | W / ↑ | Ascend |
| Fly Down | S / ↓ | Descend |
| Barrel Roll | A/D or ←/→ | Roll left/right (complete 360° for +50 pts) |
| Speed Boost | Space | Temporary speed increase |
| Loop-de-Loop | Q / E | Full rotation (complete 360° for +100 pts) |

### Obstacles
- **Buildings**: Tall structures to avoid (crash = -1 life)
- **Cranes**: Construction obstacles (crash = -1 life)
- **Rings**: Fly through for +100 points and combo boost
- **Billboards**: Near-miss for +30 points, crash = -1 life

### Scoring System
- **Distance**: Auto-scroll progression
- **Rings**: +100 points + combo multiplier increase
- **Near-miss**: +30 points (billboards)
- **Passing obstacles**: +20-40 points based on type
- **Tricks**: 
  - Barrel roll complete: +50 points
  - Loop-de-loop complete: +100 points
- **Combo multiplier**: Up to 5x for consecutive successful actions

### Visual Updates
- **Background**: City skyline with parallax clouds (3 layers)
- **Player**: Jet plane sprite (`jetplane.png`)
- **Effects**:
  - Engine exhaust trail
  - Speed boost glow
  - Turbulence sparks on near-miss
  - Trick score popups
  - Combo multiplier display

### Component Changes
- `BMXPlayer.tsx` → `JetPlane.tsx`
- `BMXBackground.tsx` → `CityBackground.tsx`
- Updated `GameObstacles.tsx` with city obstacles
- Updated `GameUI.tsx` with flight-themed UI
- Modified `useGameEngine.ts` for flight physics

## Files Modified
- ✅ App.tsx
- ✅ hooks/useGameEngine.ts
- ✅ components/game/JetPlane.tsx (new)
- ✅ components/game/GameObstacles.tsx
- ✅ components/game/GameUI.tsx
- ✅ CityBackground.tsx (new)
- ✅ package.json
- ✅ .kiro/steering/project-context.md

## Next Steps
1. Test gameplay balance
2. Adjust obstacle difficulty/spacing
3. Fine-tune scoring values
4. Add sound effects (engine, collisions, tricks)
5. Implement multiplayer leaderboard integration
6. Add more obstacle variety
7. Create power-ups (shields, magnets, etc.)
