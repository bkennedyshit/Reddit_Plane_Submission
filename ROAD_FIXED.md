# ROAD FIXED - Finally!

## ✅ What I Did

### 1. ACTUAL ROAD
- **40px tall road** stretches across ENTIRE screen
- Gray asphalt texture
- Animated yellow road lines (moving)
- White edge lines
- Road cracks/details
- Buildings sit ON it, not floating

### 2. Collision Fixed
- Touching obstacles = game over
- Small 8px margin for fairness
- Buildings, boxes, everything kills you on contact
- Touch ground = lose life

### 3. Buildings Positioned Correctly
- Background buildings sit ON the road (bottom-40)
- Foreground buildings sit ON the road (groundY - height)
- No more floating buildings
- Looks proper now

## Road Details

- **Height**: 40px
- **Width**: Full screen (100%)
- **Color**: Gray gradient (gray-800 to gray-600)
- **Lines**: Animated yellow dashes
- **Edges**: White lines top and bottom
- **Texture**: Cracks and details
- **Position**: Bottom of screen

## Why This Works

1. **Looks real** - Buildings sit ON road, not floating
2. **Clear boundary** - Road is obvious danger zone
3. **Full width** - Stretches entire screen
4. **Animated** - Road lines move (shows speed)
5. **Proper scale** - 40px is right size

## Collision

- **Touching = Death** - Any contact with obstacles
- **8px margin** - Small buffer for fairness
- **Ground = Death** - Touch road, lose life
- **Buildings** - Hit them, game over
- **Boxes** - Hit them, game over

## Testing

- [x] Road stretches full screen
- [x] Buildings sit ON road
- [x] No floating buildings
- [x] Touch obstacles = game over
- [x] Touch ground = lose life
- [x] Road lines animate
- [x] Looks proper

Finally got the fucking road right! 🛣️
