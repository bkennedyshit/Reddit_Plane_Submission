# Fixes Applied

## 1. ✅ Speed Boost Actually Works
**Problem**: D key didn't make you go faster
**Fix**: Scroll speed now increases from 3 to 6 when boosting (D or Space)
- Normal speed: 3 pixels/frame
- Boost speed (D): 6 pixels/frame  
- Obstacles move faster = you're going faster

## 2. ✅ Added Simple Box Obstacles
**Problem**: Wanted simple floating boxes like BMX game
**Fix**: Added 'box' obstacle type
- 40% spawn rate (most common)
- Float in mid-air throughout flying zone
- Orange colored with simple grid pattern
- Slight rotation animation
- +10 points for passing

## 3. ✅ Fixed Background
**Problem**: Background layers flickering/visible
**Fix**: Simplified to single cloud layer
- Removed multiple parallax layers
- Single smooth scrolling cloud layer
- No more z-index conflicts
- Cleaner, less distracting

## 4. ✅ More Obstacle Variety
**New Distribution**:
- 40% Boxes (floating, easy to dodge)
- 20% Rings (bonus points)
- 15% Billboards (near-miss bonus)
- 15% Buildings (ground obstacles)
- 10% Cranes (tall obstacles)

**Result**: More varied gameplay, more things to dodge

## 5. ✅ Difficulty Progression
**How it works**:
- More obstacles spawn as you play
- Speed boost makes game harder (faster scrolling)
- Combo multiplier rewards skilled play
- Lives system creates tension

## Reddit Game Levels

**Answer**: Most Reddit games don't have traditional levels. They use:
1. **Endless mode** - Score as high as you can (what we have)
2. **Difficulty ramp** - Gets harder over time (speed, more obstacles)
3. **Leaderboards** - Compete for high scores
4. **Daily challenges** - Optional

Our game uses endless mode with natural difficulty progression through:
- Speed boost mechanic (player controlled)
- Increasing obstacle density
- Combo multiplier (risk/reward)

This is perfect for Reddit - quick sessions, high score competition, easy to pick up.
