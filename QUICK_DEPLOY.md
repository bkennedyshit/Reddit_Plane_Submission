# üöÄ Quick Deploy Guide

## Current Status
‚úÖ Logged in as: **billykennedyshit**
‚úÖ Build complete: dist/ folder ready
‚è≥ Need to set up Devvit Web structure

## The Issue
Devvit has two types of apps:
1. **Devvit Blocks** - Server-side rendered (what `devvit upload` expects)
2. **Devvit Web** - Client-side web apps (what we built)

We built a **Devvit Web** app, which needs a different deployment approach.

## Solution: Use Devvit Web Template

### Option 1: Convert to Devvit Web (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Create a new Devvit Web project
devvit new sky-racer-web --template=web

# 2. Copy our game files into it
# Copy dist/ folder
# Copy src/main.tsx
# Copy devvit.yaml

# 3. Upload from the new project
cd sky-racer-web
devvit upload
```

### Option 2: Use Devvit Playtest (Faster)
```bash
# This starts a local server and creates a test installation
devvit playtest
```

This will:
- Start a local dev server
- Create a tunnel to your game
- Install it to a test subreddit
- Give you a link to play

## Recommended Next Steps

### Quick Test (5 minutes)
1. Create a test subreddit on Reddit
   - Go to reddit.com/subreddits/create
   - Name: `skyracertest` (or similar)
   - Type: Private (for testing)
   - Create it

2. Run playtest:
   ```bash
   devvit playtest skyracertest
   ```

3. This will give you a link to test the game

### Full Deploy (15 minutes)
1. Clone the Devvit Web template
2. Copy our game into it
3. Upload properly
4. Install to public subreddit
5. Submit to hackathon

## Alternative: Host Externally

Since we have a working web game, we could also:
1. Deploy to Vercel/Netlify (free)
2. Use that URL in a Reddit post
3. Still counts for the hackathon!

## What Do You Want to Do?

A. Try `devvit playtest` for quick testing
B. Set up proper Devvit Web structure
C. Deploy to Vercel and link from Reddit
D. Check Devvit docs for Web apps
