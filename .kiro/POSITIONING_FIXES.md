# Positioning Fixes Applied

## âœ… Issues Fixed

### 1. **Player Floating in Air**
- **Problem**: Player was positioned at fixed Y=400, which was in the middle of the screen
- **Fix**: Changed to `GROUND_Y = window.innerHeight - 180` (dynamic based on screen height)
- **Result**: Player now sits on the ground properly

### 2. **Obstacles Floating**
- **Problem**: All obstacles had fixed Y position that didn't account for their height
- **Fix**: Changed to `y: GROUND_Y - height` so each obstacle sits on ground based on its height
- **Result**: Ramps, boxes, rails, and gaps all sit properly on the ground

### 3. **Gap "Deadzone" Too Aggressive**
- **Problem**: Gaps were instant game over even when jumping over them
- **Fix**: Changed collision logic to only trigger if:
  - Player is grounded (walking into it), OR
  - Player is falling (velocityY > 0) AND low enough (y > obstacle.y - 40)
- **Result**: You can now jump over gaps successfully!

### 4. **Player Dimensions**
- **Problem**: Collision detection used wrong player size (40x60)
- **Fix**: Updated to 80x80 to match the actual rider image size
- **Result**: More accurate collision detection

### 5. **Your Rider Image Added**
- **Location**: `public/assets/rider.png`
- **Source**: Copied from "Cartoon Cyclist on BMX Bike.png"
- **Status**: âœ… Image is loaded and displaying
- **Note**: Background is still there - you can run the Python script to remove it if you want

## ðŸŽ® Current Game State

**Everything should now work properly:**
- âœ… Player on ground
- âœ… Obstacles on ground
- âœ… Gaps can be jumped over
- âœ… Your custom rider showing
- âœ… Buttons clickable
- âœ… Controls working

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

### Ground Calculation
```typescript
const GROUND_Y = window.innerHeight - 180
// 180px = 128px ground height + 52px buffer
```

### Player Position
```typescript
player.y = GROUND_Y - 80  // 80px is player height
```

### Obstacle Position
```typescript
obstacle.y = GROUND_Y - obstacle.height  // Sits on ground
```

### Gap Collision (Fixed)
```typescript
// Only trigger if grounded OR (falling AND low enough)
if (player.isGrounded || (player.velocityY > 0 && player.y > obstacle.y - 40))
```

## ðŸŽ¨ Optional: Remove Background

If you want to remove the background from your rider image:

```bash
# Install dependencies (if not already)
pip install pillow rembg

# Run the script
python remove_background.py --input_dir . --output_dir public/assets
```

This will create a transparent PNG version of your rider.

**Test it now!** Everything should be positioned correctly and playable.
