# 🎮 BMX Challenge - Setup Complete!

## ✅ What I Fixed

### 1. **Build System Setup**
- Created Vite configuration for local development
- Set up Tailwind CSS with proper config
- Fixed PostCSS configuration (ES modules issue)
- Created proper entry point (`main.tsx`)
- Updated `package.json` with correct dependencies

### 2. **Game Improvements**
- ✅ Fixed duplicate game loops
- ✅ Centralized keyboard handling
- ✅ Added trick system (Q/E for air tricks)
- ✅ Implemented combo multiplier (up to 5x!)
- ✅ Enhanced physics (acceleration, friction, air control)
- ✅ Better obstacle interactions (ramps boost, rails grind, boxes bounce)
- ✅ Visual improvements (grinding sparks, trick popups, combo display)
- ✅ Fixed framer-motion imports

### 3. **UI Components**
- Fixed import syntax in button.tsx
- Simplified globals.css for Tailwind
- All shadcn/ui components working

## 🎮 Game is Now Running!

**URL**: http://localhost:3000

### Controls:
- **Arrow Keys / WASD** - Move left/right
- **Space / Up / W** - Jump
- **Q** - Rotate left (air trick)
- **E** - Rotate right (air trick)

### Gameplay:
- Pass obstacles to score points
- Perform tricks in the air for bonus points
- Land tricks successfully to build combo multiplier
- Grind rails for continuous points + sparks
- Use ramps for boosts
- Avoid hitting boxes and gaps
