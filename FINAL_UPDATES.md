- 70-95% screen height
- Slow parallax scrolling
- Creates city atmosphere
- Doesn't interfere with gameplay

### 3. Red Buildings at Road Level (30% spawn rate)
- Most common obstacle type
- Red buildings you must fly over
- 80-140px tall
- Positioned at road level
- Yellow windows for detail
- Red glow effect

### 4. More Obstacles Overall
- Increased from 8 to 12 initial obstacles
- Spawns 4 at a time (was 3)
- Keeps 8 on screen minimum (was 6)
- Much more challenging!

### 5. Obstacle Distribution
**New spawn rates**:
- 30% Red Buildings (road level - must avoid)
- 20% Boxes (floating)
- 15% Rings (bonus points)

## Difficulty Factors

1. **Red Road** - Can't fly too low
2. **Red Buildings** - Must fly over (30% of obstacles)
3. **More Obstacles** - 12 initial, 8 minimum on screen
4. **Speed Boost** - Makes it harder but more points
5. **Floating Boxes** - Scattered throughout
6. **Combo System** - Lose multiplier on crash

## Scoring

- Red Building: +20 pts
- Box: +10 pts
- Ring: +100 pts
- Billboard: +15 pts
- Gray Building: +25 pts
- Crane: +30 pts
- **Multiplier**: Up to 5x for combos

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Red road visible at bottom
- [x] Yellow buildings fill background
- [x] Red buildings spawn frequently
- [x] Crash when hitting road
- [x] D makes obstacles scroll faster
- [x] More obstacles on screen
- [x] Good variety of obstacles

## What Makes It Hard

1. **Can't fly low** - Red road is death
2. **Must fly over red buildings** - They're everywhere (30%)
3. **Lots of obstacles** - 8-12 on screen
4. **Speed boost** - Go faster = harder to dodge
5. **Floating boxes** - Scattered in flying zone
6. **Lose combo on crash** - Punishes mistakes

## What Makes It Fun

1. **Speed control** - D for boost, risk/reward
2. **Rings** - Big bonus points
3. **Tricks** - A for barrel roll, Q/E for points
4. **Combos** - Multiplier up to 5x
5. **Visual variety** - Yellow background, red obstacles, orange boxes
6. **Clear danger** - Red = bad, yellow = background, cyan = good (rings)

## Color Coding

- **Red** - Danger (road, red buildings)
- **Yellow** - Background (tall buildings)
- **Orange** - Obstacles (boxes)
- **Cyan** - Good (rings, boost effects)
- **Gray** - Neutral (buildings, cranes)
