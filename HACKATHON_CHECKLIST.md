## 🎯 Judging Criteria (Typical)

Most hackathons judge on:

2. **Technical Implementation** (25%) - Solid React/TS ✅
3. **Design/UX** (25%) - Good visuals, needs polish 🟡
4. **Community Engagement** (25%) - Needs Reddit integration ❌

## Final Recommendation

**You're 60% done with a solid foundation.** The game is fun and unique, but you NEED the Reddit integration to qualify for the hackathon. Focus on:

1. **Priority 1**: Get it working in Reddit (critical)
2. **Priority 2**: Add leaderboard (expected feature)
3. **Priority 3**: Polish and document (makes it shine)

Skip multiplayer, power-ups, and advanced features for now. Get the core submission done first, then add extras if you have time.

**Realistic timeline**: 12-18 hours of focused work to have a competitive submission.
