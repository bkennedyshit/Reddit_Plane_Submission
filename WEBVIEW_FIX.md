# ðŸ”§ Webview Fix - Get Game Visible

## The Problem
The webview in the Reddit post can't load `index.html` because it needs a public URL.

## Quick Solution (5 minutes)

### Option 1: GitHub Pages (Recommended)
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Enable GitHub Pages for the `dist` folder
3. Update webview URL to your GitHub Pages URL
4. Re-upload to Devvit

### Option 2: Use a CDN
Upload `dist` folder to:
- Netlify Drop
- Vercel
- Cloudflare Pages

Then update the webview URL.

## Step-by-Step for GitHub Pages:

```bash
# 1. Create GitHub repo (if you haven't)
# Go to github.com and create "sky-racer" repo

# 2. Initialize git (if not done)
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Sky Racer game"

# 3. Add remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sky-racer.git

# 4. Push
git push -u origin main

# 5. Enable GitHub Pages
# Go to repo Settings â†’ Pages
# Source: Deploy from branch
# Branch: main
# Folder: /dist
# Save

# 6. Get your URL
# It will be: https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/sky-racer/

# 7. Update src/main.tsx webview URL
# Change: url="index.html"
# To: url="https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/sky-racer/"

# 8. Re-upload
devvit upload
```

## Alternative: Test Locally First

For now, let's verify the game works standalone:
```bash
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

If that works, we just need to host it publicly and update the webview URL.

## What I Changed Temporarily

I replaced the webview with a placeholder so the post at least shows something. Once you host the game, we'll update it to load the real game.

## Next Steps

1. Do you have a GitHub account?
2. Want me to help you push to GitHub?
3. Or use a different hosting option?

Let me know and I'll guide you through it!
